This is the code for my personal website [inspiredbits.org](https://inspiredbits.org).

For development, use the below flags while starting local Hugo server to access it from any device (mobile device, tablet, etc.) in the same network and bind base URL so that all pages/urls are accessible as expected:
hugo serve -D --bind=0.0.0.0 --baseURL=http://<IP>:1313
