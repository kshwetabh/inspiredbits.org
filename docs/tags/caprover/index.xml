      <description>In my effort to learn CI &amp;amp; CD and after failing badly to install Dokku on my raspberry-pi (they don&amp;rsquo;t provide precompiled binaries yet and I am not an expert in compiling linux binaries, do did not every think about that), I discovered Caprover. Its a nice little PAAS ecosystem that builds upon Docker and provides a handy dashboard (and cli tools as well if you prefer terminal) to configure, customize the application and related setups.</description>
