I will be upfront about my skills to be frugal. I do not want to spend any money just to watch Youtube without interruptions and advertisements. As it happens, by the end of last year, I was so fedup with the adverts that I was almost about to subscribe. But the frugal person in me said to stop and see if there's a (free) way around it.

I use an automation app called "Automatic Premium" on my mobile that automates few of the frequent chores in my life. We may go over those in a separate post. 
I got an idea. What if I find the `"Skip ads ->"` button while Youtube app is playing and tap on it automatically as soon as it allows that (yes, sometimes Youtube shows a countdown before displaying the Skip ads button).
